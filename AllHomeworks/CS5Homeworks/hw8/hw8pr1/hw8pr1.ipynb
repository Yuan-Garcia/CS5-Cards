    "+ a good check for if z<sub>n</sub> diverges is: abs(z) > 2\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other, equivalent definiiton sof the Mandelbrot set. For example, the Mandelbrot set consists of those points in the complex plane for which the associated *Julia set* is connected. This requires defining Julia sets... which will not be done in this assignment. \n",
